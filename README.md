# 21 Agentic Design Patterns

This repository contains the code examples for the book "21 Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems". It provides practical implementations of various agentic design patterns using modern AI frameworks and libraries.

## About the Book

"21 Agentic Design Patterns" is a comprehensive guide for developers, architects, and AI enthusiasts who want to learn how to build intelligent and autonomous systems. The book explores a wide range of patterns, from fundamental concepts like prompt chaining and tool use to advanced topics like multi-agent collaboration, reflection, and resource-aware optimization.

Each chapter in the book is accompanied by a corresponding code example in this repository, allowing readers to get hands-on experience with the patterns and apply them to their own projects.

## Key Features

*   **Practical Code Examples:** The repository contains a rich collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of each agentic design pattern.
*   **Multiple Frameworks:** The examples leverage popular AI frameworks and libraries such as the Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), LangChain, and CrewAI.
*   **Real-World Scenarios:** The patterns are illustrated with practical use cases, including customer support agents, research assistants, and code generation agents.
*   **Focus on Best Practices:** The code examples emphasize best practices for building robust, scalable, and maintainable agentic systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples, you'll need to have Python and the required libraries installed. Each notebook or script specifies its dependencies. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for this project.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is provided for general use, but the dependencies for each chapter are listed in the corresponding notebook.)
